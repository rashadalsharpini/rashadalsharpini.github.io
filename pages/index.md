I am a .NET developer with a passion for building innovative solutions that solve complex real-world problems. I actively participate in competitive programming contests such as ECPC and Mutex, where I sharpen my problem-solving and algorithmic skills. In addition, I contribute to open-source projects, collaborating with developers worldwide to create impactful software.
