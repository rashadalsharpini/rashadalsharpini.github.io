About Me

I’m a passionate .NET developer who loves turning ideas into practical, scalable software solutions. My journey in programming extends beyond development — I’m also an active competitive programmer, participating in contests like ECPC and Mutex, where I continuously refine my problem-solving and algorithmic thinking skills.

I believe in the power of open source, and I regularly contribute to projects that empower developers and communities worldwide. Whether it’s building innovative applications, tackling complex challenges, or collaborating on open-source initiatives, I’m always eager to learn, grow, and create impactful solutions.
